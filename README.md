# InfoSeek: My Snappy Search Wrapper :)

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is **InfoSeek**, my super-clean and lightning-fast search interface. Think of it as a supercharged wrapper around Google, designed for those who want to get in, search, and get out!

## The Idea

I wanted a search page that was:

*   **Minimal:** No clutter, just the essentials.
*   **Dark Mode Ready:** Because dark mode is life.
*   **Fast:** Get to your results ASAP!

## How It Works

Type your query, hit enter, and boom! You're on your way.

## Built With

*   HTML
*   CSS (with dark mode!)
*   JavaScript (for the theme toggle and search)

## What I Learned

*   CSS Variables are awesome.
*   `localStorage` is super handy for saving user preferences.
